#Savannah-June-2015-DMSP-Predictors

The purpose of this project is to explore predictor variables for the production of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in the waters off of Savannah, GA in the South Atlantic Bight. 

DMSP, produced by certain phytoplankton, breaks down into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) which can create cloud-condensation nuclei (ccn). This makes the production of DMSP by phytoplankton a widely studied phenomenon in biogeochemistry, as cloud-condenstaion nuclei can effect sea surface and land temperatures, contributing to changes in earth's climate. 

This project takes physical variables and phytoplankton pigment data from a cross-shelf transect off of Savannah, GA and uses them as predictor variables for DMSP particulate (DMSPp) in seawater samples. The physical variables were recorded using a CTD device, and the pigment data and DMSP data were recorded from seawaters samples brought up from various depths at stations along the transect. Pigment data collection can be attributed to Nicole Schanke and DMSP measures to Peter Lee and Jeanette Zavala.

#Methods

An exploratory analysis was carried out where DMSPp (particulate DMSP), DMSPd (in vivo DMSP), and DMS were included in an OLS model that evaluated 45 variables. 

Addtionally, two pigments of interest (19-Hex and Peridinin) were evaluated with respect to Salinity, Temperature, and Depth. The same was done comparing Silca data with Salinity, Temperature, and Depth parameters. 

A metadata file displays the relationship between listed pigments and the phytoplankton species that they are found in, allowing us to make predictions about the types of phytoplankton present off Savannah in June 2015.
